# Project Title: Analysis of Heart Disease Trends

## Project Overview
This project analyzes trends in heart disease using a dataset from UCI. The aim is to identify key factors contributing to cardiovascular health by exploring relationships between age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate.

## Files in the Repository
- `heart_disease_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all the data analysis code and visualizations.
- `data/heart_disease_data.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the notebook.

## Setup and Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/Statistics-and-Trends-20-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Statistics-and-Trends-20-
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run the Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment:
```
jupyter notebook heart_disease_analysis.ipynb
```
Execute the cells in sequence to view the analysis and visualizations.
